  Lambda used to forward messages received by SES and S3 to an external mailbox
usage: |-

  Terraform:

  ```hcl
  module "ses-email-forwarder-lambda" {
    source = "git::ssh://git@gitlab.com:miquido/terraform/terraform-ses-email-forwarder-lambda.git?ref=master"

    name                           = "main"
    namespace                      = "project"
    stage                          = "example"
    ses_region                     = "eu-west-1"
    mail_sender                    = "noreply-forwarder@example.com"
    mail_recipient                 = "example@example.com"
    mail_s3_bucket                 = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
    mail_s3_bucket_prefix          = "emails/example.com/"
    reserved_concurrent_executions = -1
  }
  ```

  ### Developer notes

  * It is recommended to set `MailSender` environment variable carefully to not create email loop in case of receving bounce message (which will be forwarded again, and again..)
  * Highly based on: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/messaging-and-targeting/forward-incoming-email-to-an-external-destination/
